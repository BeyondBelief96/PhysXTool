# **PhysXTool**

## Description
PhysXTool is designed to be a comprehensive hub for physics calcuations using widgets or apps, built either by myself or others in the community. The app was built using .NET's WPF (Windows Presentation Framework) for the frontend, and C# for the backend. To contribute to this project, all that is needed is to create a custom user control that does whatever physics calucations you want it to do.
